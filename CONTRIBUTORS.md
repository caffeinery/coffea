# Contributors

Many thanks to everyone contributing to coffea, <3 all of you.

The list is sorted by name A-Z, used `git log --format=' * %aN' | sort -u` to generate the list.

Some contributors may be part of [slate-irc](https://github.com/slate/slate-irc) and not coffea directly as coffea started out as a slate-irc fork. - Special thanks to those guys!

Feel free to add yourself with a note about what you added (e.g. link to pull request, short description) or ask me to add you.
