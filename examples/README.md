# [coffea](https://github.com/caffeinery/coffea) > examples

This folder contains a few files that show how coffea works without any other
dependencies. This means they contain an implementation of a protocol and the
actual app. Usually, the protocol will [already be developed and available as an
npm package](#protocols).

 * [simple example](simple.js) (simple protocol function)
 * [advanced example](advanced.js) (split protocol into multiple functions)
